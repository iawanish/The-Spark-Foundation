                    Help Save Animals</p>
                <p class="text-small">
                    Cats and dogs depend on humans for their everyday needs – food, water, shelter, veterinary care,
                    love, and more. Yet thousands of animals across the UK have no guardian to care for them, let alone
                    a warm, comfortable place to curl up at night. Many suffer and die on the streets or have to be
                    euthanised for lack of good homes. Animal homelessness is a complex crisis, but the solution is
                    simple: adopt animals from shelters or the streets instead of buying them from breeders or pet
                    shops, and prevent unwanted animals from being born by always having your companion animals spayed
                    or neutered.</p>

                Who’s to Blame?
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Why are so many animals homeless? Breeders and pet trade are major contributors to this crisis because
                they bring more puppies and kittens into a world that doesn’t have enough good homes for all the animals
                who already exist. Puppy and kitten mills – which supply animals to pet shops – churn out litter after
                litter, and many of the dogs and cats bred by breeders will either become homeless themselves or fill
                homes that could have gone to animals waiting in shelters. Puppies and kittens bought from breeders or
                pet shops are often taken away from their mother at just a few weeks old, leaving them sickly,
                traumatised, and unsocialised. This can lead to physical and mental health issues that many people are
                unable or unwilling to deal with.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                The simplest, most important, and most effective way to spare cats and dogs all this suffering is to
                prevent more unwanted animals from being born by making sure that animals are spayed or neutered.

                Every animal who is sterilised prevents potentially hundreds of thousands more from being born only to
                suffer and die on the streets, be abused by cruel or neglectful people, or be euthanised for lack of
                loving homes. Without spaying, one female dog and her offspring can produce 67,000 puppies in just six
                years. In seven years, one female cat and her offspring can produce a staggering 370,000 kittens!

                What You Can Do
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Each of us can help work towards a day when every animal can have a loving, permanent home by having our
                animal companions spayed or neutered and by always adopting animals, never buying them from pet shops or
                breeders. And encourage everyone you know to do the same! It’s also important to consider whether we’re
                prepared to take on the lifelong commitment of caring for an animal before adding a new member to the
                family.
